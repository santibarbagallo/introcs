operand1=95
operand2=64.5

print operand1+operand2
print operand1-operand2
print operand1*operand2
print operand1/operand2
print operand1%operand2

#if the value of operand 1 is changed, then only the value of the variable has to change,
#since the problems have the variable and not a certain number.

#this makes the procedure and work much easier, since you dont 
#have to rewrite everyhting if you want to change somehting.

#i got the solution by using both variables in different equations,
#and then from there you will get the answer.
